## Introduction

The Snake game is a timeless classic where the player controls a snake that grows in length as it eats food. The goal is to eat as much food as possible without colliding with the walls or the snake's own body. This implementation is built using Python and Pygame, making it easy to understand, modify, and extend.

## Features

- **Classic Gameplay**: Relive the nostalgia of the original Snake game with simple yet addictive gameplay.
- **Score Tracking**: Keep track of your score as you play. The longer the snake, the higher the score!
- **Game Over Screen**: When the game ends, a game over screen displays your final score.
- **Customizable Settings**: Easily modify game settings like snake speed, window size, and colors.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Installation

To run the Snake Game on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TeymurkhanliNurhan/SnakeGame.git
   cd SnakeGame
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. Then, install the required Pygame library:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```

3. **Run the Game**:
   Execute the Python script to start the game:
   ```bash
   python snake_game.py
   ```

## How to Play

The objective of the game is to control the snake and eat the food that appears on the screen. Each time the snake eats the food, it grows longer, and your score increases. The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or its own body.

## Controls

- **Arrow Keys**: Use the arrow keys (`‚Üë`, `‚Üì`, `‚Üê`, `‚Üí`) to control the direction of the snake.
- **Pause**: Press `P` to pause the game.
- **Quit**: Press `Q` to quit the game at any time.

## Customization

You can easily customize the game by modifying the following variables in the `snake_game.py` file:

- **Window Size**: Change the `WIDTH` and `HEIGHT` variables to adjust the game window size.
- **Snake Speed**: Modify the `SNAKE_SPEED` variable to make the snake move faster or slower.
- **Colors**: Adjust the `COLORS` dictionary to change the colors of the snake, food, and background.
